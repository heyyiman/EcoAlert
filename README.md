### **EcoAlert: A Smarter Way to Tackle Waste Management in Malaysia**

    EcoAlert is more than just a prototype—it’s a game-changer in environmental monitoring! Designed by four students from Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, this platform empowers Malaysians to take action against pollution.

    Our mission? To support the government in identifying and addressing critical environmental issues that often go unnoticed. With EcoAlert, users can easily submit reports on land pollution, water contamination, and road hazards, ensuring a cleaner, safer Malaysia for everyone.
